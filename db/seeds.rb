  "<p>Three, and more than you'd expect!</p>

  <p>You could center a div horizontally, vertically, or both and there are
  a ton of ways to do them each. It also depends on what you're trying to
  center. The most common way I do it is using the margins. If you set
    a div's margin to 0 auto, to will automatically get the width of the
    client's screen and use that information to center the div.</p>

  <p>If I had text within a div, I wold use the text-align: center css
  attribute on the div.</p>"

  you want your friends to read. For them to read your notes, you
  need to also give them the note right? Well that is what the Internet
  does for you. It sends the websites to the people who want to read
  them.</p>

  <p>The best part is, you know how you don't want Ms. Robinson to see

  "The Internet has a technical side and a social side. There's the

  the sites.</p>

  <p>I imagine you guys are interested in the technical side though
  right? (Yes)</p>

  <p>In short, I'd say it's a communication network designed
  to deliver messages between computers. One of the most interesting
  things about it, I think, is that in the end, it really is a
  bunch of cables! Some run under the oceans, others go through
  mountains and under forests. Some signals travel through space! All
  the code we write goes through those cables, I think that's pretty
  amazing!</p>"

  found myself writing Python scripts to build simple web scrapers and
  spiders.</p>

  <p>It was exciting, I discovered coding makes me happy not just for
