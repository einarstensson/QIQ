  "<p>Three, and more than you'd expect!</p>

  <p>You could center a div horizontally, vertically, or both and there are
  a ton of ways to do them each. It also depends on what you're trying to
  center. The most common way I do it is using the margins. If you set
    a div's margin to 0 auto, to will automatically get the width of the
    client's screen and use that information to center the div.</p>

  <p>If I had text within a div, I wold use the text-align: center css
  attribute on the div.</p>"

  "<p>You know when you write notes and pass them to Suzie from
  down the street? That's kind of what I do. Websites are like notes
  you want your friends to read. For them to read your notes, you
  need to also give them the note right? Well that is what the Internet
  does for you. It sends the websites to the people who want to read
  them.</p>

  <p>The best part is, you know how you don't want Ms. Robinson to see
  you pass that note? It's like that with the Internet too. There's
  ways of keeping the visits to your website secret!</p>"

  "The Internet has a technical side and a social side. There's the
  infrastructure, like routers, cables, satelites, ISPs, servers,
  and website code, and there are the users who participate in the
  Internet by creating content for it's applications and browsing
  the sites.</p>

  <p>I imagine you guys are interested in the technical side though
  right? (Yes)</p>

  <p>In short, I'd say it's a communication network designed
  to deliver messages between computers. One of the most interesting
  things about it, I think, is that in the end, it really is a
  bunch of cables! Some run under the oceans, others go through
  mountains and under forests. Some signals travel through space! All
  the code we write goes through those cables, I think that's pretty
  amazing!</p>"

  "<p>For me, it started back in 2011 when I was doing social science
  at Stockholm University. The creation of communities had become a
  passion of mine so I was exploring ways of finding data on
  social networks. The Internet was the obvious place to look so I
  found myself writing Python scripts to build simple web scrapers and
  spiders.</p>

  <p>It was exciting, I discovered coding makes me happy not just for
  the results it creates but because I like the way it looks. Solving
  problems is interesting.</p>"
